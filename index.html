    <h1>Pet Adoption</h1>


    <h2>Why pet adoption over buying?</h2>

        <p>Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog or cat, and rightly so, there are many benefits to adopting a pet. Pet adoption fees are usually much lower than buying from a breeder. You’re also likely to find a pet who’s already learned a few things. Adoptable pets are often already housetrained, good with kids, and do well with other pets. And don’t forget the wonderful feeling you get from saving a life!</p>

    <h3>What is your perfect pet?</h3>

    <p>Do you know what pet fits your lifestyle? What personality do you want in a pet? Do you want a pet that goes outdoors or a pet that stays indoors all the time? What about an animal that gets along with other pets or kids?</p>
